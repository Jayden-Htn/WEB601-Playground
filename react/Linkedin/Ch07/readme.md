Using react create app to generate a basic app structure

Terminal commands: 
- npx create-react-app app-name: generates app
- npm start: starts server on localhost:3000

Notes:
- index.html is the main file that will render the app.
- public/index.html has root element to inject code
- App.js: stores main app component
- App.css stores css for main component
