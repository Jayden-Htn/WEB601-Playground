# React

This folder is following the Linkedin tutorial React.js Essential training by Eve Porcello.

I have not used React before, but I have been wanting to learn it for a while. The learnings from this course will be used in WEB601 assessment 2.


## Learnings

In html body:
<script type="type/javascript">
    ReactDom.render(React.createElement('tag', properties, 'Text'), document.getElementById('root'));
</script>
